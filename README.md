Coursera capstone project analyzing bike-share usage data using Excel
# Bike-Share Data Analysis Capstone Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate capstone. The goal of this analysis was to examine bike-share usage data over a 12-month period to identify trends, usage patterns, and key differences in rider behavior. Insights from this analysis can help inform data-driven business decisions related to customer engagement and operational planning.

---

## 🎯 Business Question
How do bike-share usage patterns differ across months, and what trends can be identified to support strategic planning and customer retention?

---

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
- Pivot Tables
- Charts & Data Visualizations
- Microsoft Word (final report)

---

## 📂 Dataset
- 12 months of historical bike-share trip data
- Data included ride duration, start and end stations, rider type, and timestamps

> Note: Data was provided as part of the Coursera capstone project and has been cleaned and modified for analysis purposes.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation
The following steps were taken to prepare the data for analysis:
- Removed rows with missing or invalid station data
- Standardized column formats across all monthly datasets
- Added calculated columns (e.g., ride length, month)
- Separated monthly data for individual and year-over-year analysis
- Validated data integrity by refreshing pivot tables after updates

---

## 📊 Analysis Process
- Created monthly pivot tables to analyze:
  - Average ride length
  - Ride volume by month
- Built a year-end summary pivot table to compare trends across all 12 months
- Developed charts and visualizations to highlight seasonal patterns and usage trends
- Compared rider behavior across different time periods

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Bike usage varies significantly by month, with higher ride volume during warmer months
- Average ride length fluctuates seasonally
- Certain months consistently show increased demand, suggesting opportunities for targeted campaigns or operational scaling

---

## 📈 Visualizations
This repository includes:
- Monthly pivot tables
- Summary charts showing usage trends
- Visual comparisons across months

📄 A PDF containing all pivot tables and summary charts is included in this repository.

---

## 📄 Final Deliverable
- A written analysis report summarizing findings and insights
- Supporting Excel files with cleaned data, pivot tables, and charts

---

## 🚀 Next Steps
If this analysis were expanded further, future work could include:
- Rider segmentation analysis
- Forecasting demand using historical trends
- Integration with SQL or BI tools such as Power BI or Tableau
- Automating monthly reporting dashboards
